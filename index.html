  How many souls exist = 1 zillion

 </h2>

 <h3>

  The human population is increasing by 1.05% per year , at this rate if it even takes a lot of time eventually we will reach 1 zillion humans. According to his theory for a human to exist they need a soul in there body. After this if a human is born it will die . That means the human population can't be more than a zillion. 

 </h3>

 <h3 id="footer">Aadhith created this theory because he saw <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/k4rQdkbDVc8?feature=share">this</a> video and this video shows that a kid remembers his last life killer.</h3>
